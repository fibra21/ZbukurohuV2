# Frontend Bug Fixes - ZBUKUROHU

## Overview
This document outlines all the frontend bugs and permission handling issues that have been fixed to ensure the platform is secure, responsive, and accessible.

## âœ… **Fixed Issues**

### 1. **Role-Based Access Control**
- **Problem**: Buttons/menus for distributor or B2B were visible for all users
- **Solution**: 
  - Created `RoleGuard` and `withRoleGuard` HOC components
  - Implemented conditional rendering based on user roles
  - Added "Apply to become distributor/business" options for customers
  - Updated dashboard routes with proper role protection

### 2. **Dashboard Route Security**
- **Problem**: Dashboard routes rendered client-side even without token (401 handled only in console)
- **Solution**:
  - Added client-side redirect to `/login` if no token found
  - Implemented `RoleGuard` component for route protection
  - Added loading states and proper authentication checks

### 3. **Role-Based Pricing Display**
- **Problem**: Cart/Checkout showed retail pricing for B2B users
- **Solution**:
  - Updated `MiniCartDrawer` to show wholesale pricing for business users
  - Modified `ProductCard` to display role-appropriate pricing
  - Added wholesale price indicators and minimum order quantities
  - Implemented price calculation based on user role

### 4. **Session State Management**
- **Problem**: UI showed role-specific components after logout or token expiration
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced `AuthContext` with proper session management
  - Added session refresh on navigation
  - Implemented automatic logout on token expiration
  - Added proper state reset on logout

### 5. **Input Validation**
- **Problem**: Missing validation for sensitive fields (discount codes, wholesale qty)
- **Solution**:
  - Created comprehensive validation utility (`/utils/validation.ts`)
  - Added validation rules for distributor and business applications
  - Implemented real-time field validation with error messages
  - Added form submission validation with user feedback

### 6. **User Feedback System**
- **Problem**: Missing feedback when applying for distributor role or saving profile
- **Solution**:
  - Created toast notification system (`/components/ui/Toast.tsx`)
  - Added loading states for form submissions
  - Implemented success/error messages for all user actions
  - Added progress indicators for long-running operations

### 7. **Accessibility Improvements**
- **Problem**: Buttons missing aria-labels, missing alt text in product images
- **Solution**:
  - Added proper `aria-label` attributes to all interactive elements
  - Enhanced product image alt text with descriptive information
  - Implemented focus states with `focus-visible:ring` classes
  - Added ARIA roles and descriptions for complex components
  - Improved keyboard navigation and screen reader support

### 8. **Route Protection**
- **Problem**: Hidden elements accessible via direct URL navigation
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented `RoleGuard` component for conditional rendering
  - Added client-side route protection with redirects
  - Created higher-order component for wrapping protected pages
  - Ensured unauthorized users cannot access restricted features

## ðŸ”§ **New Components Created**

### Authentication & Security
- `withRoleGuard.tsx` - Higher-order component for role-based protection
- `RoleGuard.tsx` - Standalone role guard component
- `RoleBasedMenu.tsx` - Dynamic menu based on user role
- `DistributorApplicationForm.tsx` - Form for distributor applications
- `BusinessApplicationForm.tsx` - Form for business applications
